# TransformerWordEmbeddings

Thanks to the brilliant [`transformers`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) library from [HuggingFace](https://github.com/huggingface), 
Flair is able to support various Transformer-based architectures like BERT or XLNet. 

As of version 0.5 of Flair, there is a single class for all transformer embeddings that you instantiate with different identifiers get different transformers. For instance, to load a standard BERT transformer model, do:  

```python
from flair.embeddings import TransformerWordEmbeddings

# init embedding
embedding = TransformerWordEmbeddings('bert-base-uncased')

# create a sentence
sentence = Sentence('The grass is green .')

# embed words in sentence
embedding.embed(sentence)
```

If instead you want to use RoBERTa, do: 

```python
from flair.embeddings import TransformerWordEmbeddings

# init embedding
embedding = TransformerWordEmbeddings('roberta-base')

# create a sentence
sentence = Sentence('The grass is green .')

# embed words in sentence
embedding.embed(sentence)
```

[Here](https://huggingface.co/transformers/pretrained_models.html) is a full list of all models (BERT, RoBERTa, XLM, XLNet etc.). You can use any of these models with this class. 


## Arguments

There are several options that you can set when you init the TransformerWordEmbeddings class:

| Argument             | Default             | Description
| -------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| `model` | `bert-base-uncased` | The string identifier of the transformer model you want to use (see above)
| `layers`             | `-1,-2,-3,-4`       | Defines the layers of the Transformer-based model that produce the embedding
| `pooling_operation`  | `first`             | See [Pooling operation section](#Pooling-operation).
| `use_scalar_mix`     | `False`             | See [Scalar mix section](#Scalar-mix).
| `batch_size`     | 1             | How many sentences to push through transformer simultaneously (high means faster but more memory usage)
| `fine_tune`     | `False`             | Whether or not embeddings are fine-tuneable.
| `allow_long_sentences`     | `False`             | Whether or not texts longer than maximal sequence length are supported.


### Layers

The `layers` argument controls which transformer layers are used for the embedding. If you set this value to '-1,-2,-3,-4', the top 4 layers are used to make an embedding. If you set it to '-1', only the last layer is used. If you set it to "all", then all layers are used.

This affects the length of an embedding, since layers are just concatenated. 

```python
from flair.data import Sentence
from flair.embeddings import TransformerWordEmbeddings

sentence = Sentence('The grass is green.')

# use only last layers
embeddings = TransformerWordEmbeddings('bert-base-uncased', layers='-1')
embeddings.embed(sentence)
print(sentence[0].embedding.size())

sentence.clear_embeddings()

# use last two layers
embeddings = TransformerWordEmbeddings('bert-base-uncased', layers='-1,-2')
embeddings.embed(sentence)
print(sentence[0].embedding.size())

sentence.clear_embeddings()

# use ALL layers
embeddings = TransformerWordEmbeddings('bert-base-uncased', layers='all')
embeddings.embed(sentence)
print(sentence[0].embedding.size())
```

This should print: 
```console
torch.Size([768])
torch.Size([1536])
torch.Size([9984])
```

I.e. the size of the embedding increases the mode layers we use.


### Pooling operation

Most of the Transformer-based models (except Transformer-XL) use subword tokenization. E.g. the following
token `puppeteer` could be tokenized into the subwords: `pupp`, `##ete` and `##er`.

We implement different pooling operations for these subwords to generate the final token representation:

* `first`: only the embedding of the first subword is used
* `last`: only the embedding of the last subword is used
* `first_last`: embeddings of the first and last subwords are concatenated and used
* `mean`: a `torch.mean` over all subword embeddings is calculated and used

You can choose which one to use by passing this in the constructor: 

```python
# use first and last subtoken for each word
embeddings = TransformerWordEmbeddings('bert-base-uncased', pooling_operation='first_last')
embeddings.embed(sentence)
print(sentence[0].embedding.size())
```

### Scalar mix

The Transformer-based models have a certain number of layers. [Liu et. al (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08855)
propose a technique called scalar mix, that computes a parameterised scalar mixture of user-defined layers.

This technique is very useful, because for some downstream tasks like NER or PoS tagging it can be unclear which
layer(s) of a Transformer-based model perform well, and per-layer analysis can take a lot of time.

To use scalar mix, all Transformer-based embeddings in Flair come with a `use_scalar_mix` argument. The following
example shows how to use scalar mix for a base RoBERTa model on all layers:

```python
from flair.embeddings import TransformerWordEmbeddings

# init embedding
embedding = TransformerWordEmbeddings("roberta-base", layers="all", use_scalar_mix=True)

# create a sentence
sentence = Sentence("The Oktoberfest is the world's largest Volksfest .")

# embed words in sentence
embedding.embed(sentence)
```

### Fine-tuneable or not

In some setups, you may wish to fine-tune the transformer embeddings. In this case, set fine_tune=True in the init method: 

```python
# use first and last subtoken for each word
embeddings = TransformerWordEmbeddings('bert-base-uncased', fine_tune=True)
embeddings.embed(sentence)
print(sentence[0].embedding)
```

This will print a tensor that now has a gradient function and can be fine-tuned if you use it in a training routine.

```python
tensor([-0.0323, -0.3904, -1.1946,  ...,  0.1305, -0.1365, -0.4323],
       device='cuda:0', grad_fn=<CatBackward>)
```
